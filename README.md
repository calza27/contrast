Puzzle platformer built in the Godot engine.

There are three different coloured platforms, black, white and grey.
Changing the background colour of the level will change which platforms are visible. The player will only interact with the visible platforms.

Controls by default are arrow keys left/right to move, space to jump, and the up/down keys to switch between black and white background colours.
